            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from the bodie, hee ≈øaw the iu≈øt iudgments of God, &amp; afterward beeing returned to him≈øelf, by &amp; by he de≈øpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched away all tho≈øe that then wear with him in his ≈øel, and their ≈øhut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf vp, and liued with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter xij. yeares, neuer ≈øpeaking to any per≈øon ≈øo much as one woord, vntil hee was neer vnto death, that then the other monkes de≈øirous to receaue, of him ≈øome good in≈øtructions did break open his chamber door and entred in vnto him, and prayed him that it might not bee grieuous vnto him, in this his la≈øt hower, to ≈øpeak in the way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, for the edification of others, and di≈øclo≈øe vnto them in what manner ≈øo ≈øudaynlie from ≈øo great negligence, hee was come to ≈øo great perfection, who after much intreatie, made them this an≈øwere: pardon mee yf I do not v≈øe many words, and a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelues, none can euer ≈øinne grieuou≈øly which haue the true feeling of the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>brance of death.

following, when his bones were ≈øought by ≈øuch as de≈øired to reuerence them, they wear not found. Whereby they knew how much the feeling in deed of the remembrance of death doth plea≈øe God, and what effect it woorketh, and how expedient it is for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to become good: ≈øince that in one moment it can make euen tho≈øe that bee verie negligent, zealou≈øly di≈øpo≈øed and mo≈øt feruent to euerie good woork. And now ≈øeeing that with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitie then I ment I haue handled this fir≈øt rule, the more to ≈øhew the vtilitie thereof, the ≈øhorter wil I now enforce my ≈øelf to be in the rules following.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ≈øecond rule.</note> THE ≈øecond principal rule of the arte to dy wel con≈øi≈øteth in di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeing of a mannes la≈øt wil and te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a wy≈øe man ought not to dy without making his te≈øtament. And although hee bee willing to make it, yet ought hee not to deferre it to the la≈øt extremitie. Therefore ≈øaid Iacob to Laban,<note place="margin">Gene≈ø. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Iu≈øtum e≈øt, vt aliquando domut meae
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15004:26"/>
di≈øponam,</hi> that is to ≈øay: It is meet, that without any more adoe I di≈øpo≈øe of my how≈øe. And E≈øay ≈øaid to Ezechias king of Iudea: <hi>Di≈øpone domut tuae, quia,</hi>

Hee that at the beginning of his ≈øicknes maketh his te≈øtament, may the better prouyde for him≈øelf and his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becau≈øe he taketh the fitter opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to do it with greater fore≈øight and iudgement, and is more readdie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward at the point of death to attend to the health of his ≈øoule.</p>
               <p>The diuel doth his endeuour to make thee defer the making of thy te≈øtament, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t that after when thow ≈øhalt be grieued with thy ≈øicknes, thow maye≈øt al≈øo be troubled with thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and kinred, who all ≈øeek their owne commoditie and litle care for thy ≈øoules health. Therefore yf thow bee wy≈øe, thow wilt make thy te≈øtament ≈øo ≈øoone as thow can≈øt: and to the end thow maye≈øt make it as it beheueth &amp; with the more commoditie I wil teach
<pb facs="tcp:15004:27"/>
thee certaine ≈øecrets concerning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øame.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt then I mu≈øt put thee in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that thow do not to much tru≈øte vnto freindes or kinsfolkes, when they promi≈ø≈øe thee to do good for thy ≈øoule after thy death, for yf in thy lyf tyme thow wilt bee negligent to procure help and nece≈ø≈øary prayers for thy ≈øelf, far more negligent wil they bee when thow arte gone. This is ≈øo playnlie ≈øeene euerie day by manife≈øt experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, that it would ≈øeeme a thing vtterly needles to go about to proue it.</p>
               <p>Secondlie I am to aduerti≈øe thee<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that thow ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øt not make any legacies which can bee more profitable for thy ≈øoule, then legacies to haue ma≈ø≈øes ≈øayd for thee, the which is proued by all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, &amp; chiefly by Gabriel Beele vpon the canon of the Ma≈ø≈øe, and by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctor S. Thomas Aquinas vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the fourth of the ≈øentences. Who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Ma≈ø≈øe to bee alwayes auayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ≈øoules that are in purgatorie, yea although the prie≈øt which ≈øaid it

were in deadlie ≈øinne, becau≈øe he as the mini≈øter; ≈øayeth it in the per≈øon of the Churche militant, which is euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie I adui≈øe thee, that thow or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne and appoynt thy legacies in ≈øuch wy≈øe, as without delay after thow be dead, they may bee performed and thy wil executed, a≈øwel for the ma≈ø≈øes, as for the almes which thow ≈øhalt leaue to be be≈øtowed. For (as Iohn Ger≈øon ≈øayth) far better it is to haue them ≈øaid out of hand, then to tarie diuers yeares, becau≈øe the ≈øooner they be ≈øaid, the ≈øooner the ≈øoules be deliuered out of the paynes of purgatorie.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie I mu≈øt put thee in mynde to confe≈ø≈øe thy ≈øelf, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate before thow make thy te≈øtament. For when thereby thow art the more in the fauour of God, legacies of almes &amp; ma≈ø≈øes do far more auaile thee, then yf thow weert out of the ≈øtate of grace. This is grounded vpon the doctrine of S. Thomas in the fourth of the ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, where hee ≈øaith, the ≈øatisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:15004:28"/>
inioyned of the confe≈ø≈øor made when thow art in deadly ≈øinne doth not take away the payne of the ≈øinne remitted: although the opinion of Scotus, which holdeth the contrarie, bee more fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but yet in our ca≈øe I iudge that of S. Thomas to be the more ≈øure.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly there is come to my mynde an other thing to remember thee of, which I heard of that noble capitaine Bartholomew of Bergamo, which is, that yf thow wilt make a ≈øingular good te≈øtament and a perfect preparation, to dy wel; then beare thy ≈øelf alwayes in ≈øuch ≈øorte while≈øt thow art a liue, and let thy wordes bee ≈øo charitable direct and cleere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cerning thy la≈øt wil in thy lyfe tyme, that after thy death no man may haue iu≈øt cau≈øe to complayne of thee. Yf thow arte a ≈øecular man in thus doing thow mai≈øt leaue thy heyres in peace without ≈øtryf, which is the be≈øt inheritance that thow mai≈øt leaue vnto them, &amp; moreouer thow doe≈øt therein the better prouyde for thy ≈øaluation &amp; theirs, and therefore thow oughte≈øt in

any ca≈øe to ob≈øerue this good &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble le≈øso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in the making of thy te≈øtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t.</p>
               <p>But yf thow bee a ≈øpiritual man not hauing worldlie goods to di≈øtribute, thow maye≈øt make a ≈øpiritual te≈øtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, after the example of many ≈øainctes, which haue ≈øpoken in their te≈øtaments not of wordlie wealth &amp; earthlie po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øsions, but of ≈øpiritual and heauenly thinges.</p>

Therefore wee ought euerie day to pray vnto God, that he wil for his infinite goodnes graunt vs a good and happie end. In ob≈øeruing the cu≈øtome ≈øo to pray, S. Augu≈øtine, and S.

A chanon reguler of the order of S.
